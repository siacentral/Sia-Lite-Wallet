Sia Central's Lite Wallet is a secure cryptocurrency wallet web app with support for Siacoin (SC) and ScPrimeCoin (SCP). This wallet has been tested and works with Chromium based browsers on Desktop, iOS 11, and Chrome on Android. Sensitive data, such as wallet seeds, is stored encrypted using a user-set passphrase and never leaves the device.

### Supported Wallet Types

#### Seed Wallets
Seed wallets are created or recovered from a 29-word recovery phrase. These wallets are fully compatible with the official Sia and ScPrime wallets. The seed is encrypted and stored locally with a user provided unlock password. The seed never leaves the device, removing any risk of exposure.

#### Ledger Hardware Wallets
Ledger hardware wallets communicate using Ledger's secure transport. The seed cannot be retrieved from the Ledger device. Addresses are imported from the device to view balance and build transactions. The Ledger device is required to sign and confirm any transactions before being broadcast to the Sia network.

To enable Ledger support you need to be on a recent Chromium based desktop browser (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Microsoft Edge) and enable `Experimental Web Platform Features` from [chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features)

#### Watch-Only Wallets
Watch-Only wallets are read-only wallets used to monitor the balance of a group of addresses. Addresses to watch are imported manually to view balance.


### How It Works

This wallet uses a Sia wrapper that allows parts of Sia to be run directly in the browser. This lets the wallet generate, recover seeds, addresses, and sign transactions without using an external server or daemon. The wallet uses the Sia Central Explorer API to retrieve balance and transaction data without downloading the full blockchain.  All transaction generation and signing happens locally, the signed transaction is then broadcast to the network.
