      <h3>Supported Wallet Types</h3>
      <h4>Seed Wallets</h4>
      <p>
        Seed wallets are created or recovered from a 29-word recovery phrase.
        These wallets are fully compatible with the official Sia and ScPrime
        wallets. The seed is encrypted and stored locally with a user provided
        unlock password. The seed never leaves the device, removing any risk of
        exposure.
      </p>
      <h4>Ledger Hardware Wallets</h4>
      <p>
        Ledger hardware wallets communicate using Ledger's secure transport. The
        seed cannot be retrieved from the Ledger device. Addresses are imported
        from the device to view balance and build transactions. The Ledger
        device is required to sign and confirm any transactions before being
        broadcast to the Sia network.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enable Ledger support you need to be on a recent Chromium based
        desktop browser (Chrome, Brave, Opera, Microsoft Edge) and enable
        Experimental Web Platform Features from
        <i>chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Watch-Only Wallets</h4>
      <p>
        Watch-Only wallets are read-only wallets used to monitor the balance of
        a group of addresses. Addresses to watch are imported manually to view
        balance.
